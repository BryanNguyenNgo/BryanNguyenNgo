I have been learning how to code for five years, these are some of the projects I have done.

Secondary school projects:
1. SwiftUI app: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/KeepYourSleep
I made an app for teenagers to sleep better for a STEM project for school. The app has features like a shop to make teenagers want to sleep more and tips to help them have a good night's rest.

2. AWS Accelerator Program: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/AWSAcceleratorProgram
I attended an accelerator program to learn about AWS's cloud services and how they are used in our daily lives. My team had to solve a problem of how to alleviate manpower problems in Seoul Garden outlets and we created a front-desk application to smoothen and make the ordering process at Seoul Garden so employees will not have to be at the front desk all the time.

Primary school projects:
1. Robotics with mBot: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/Mbot
I learnt and had experiences on how to design, write and debug program using the Makeblock software to help mBot to complete missions and challenges. For examples, differentiate colours, perform line-following shapes such as number 8-shaped or letter T-shaped, complex movement and avoid obstacles.

2. App Development with MIT App Inventor 2: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/MITAppInventor
I learnt and had experiences building interactive mobile apps run on Android devices. I understood block-based coding and upload of application file and installation onto Android devices. During this course, I created fun and interesting apps e.g Flappy Bird, BMI Calculation and a Pitch Trainer.

3. Web Development with HTML 5, CSS 3 & Bootstrap: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/HTML
I understood the elements involved in the creations of webpages, and how to organise elements of webpages. I created my own unique portfolio webpages using Cascading Style Sheets and bootstrap, responsive and reactive Carousels and Cards as well as real-world theme e-commerce and blog post.

4. Computer Science Advanced with Python 3: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/Python
I learnt programming syntax fundamentals, usage of Python libraries and packages for utility applications. I learnt object oriented, Model-View-Controller. During this course, I created automated name list for classes, a game using Pygame,
a cars website that has a login and speed calculator.

5. Web Development with Javascript
I am learning javascript programming language to create a shopping cart in the E-commerce website. Exploring different type of inputs, colours and shapes on a web page, creating interactive filtering, using jQuery and JSON.
