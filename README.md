**My Digital Portfolio**

I have been learning programming for the past six years, and these are some of the projects I have completed during that time.

This portfolio showcases my key projects and learning experiences during secondary school, with a focus on software development and real-world problem solving. Below is a timeline of my major projects, followed by detailed descriptions.

I participated in the **AWS Accelerator Program**, where I gained hands-on experience with AWS cloud services and their real-world applications.  

In a team project, we addressed manpower challenges at Seoul Garden restaurants by developing a front-desk web application.  
The solution aimed to:
- Streamline the ordering process
- Reduce the need for staff at the front desk
- Improve efficiency during peak hours

  
## 2. KeepYourSleep (SwiftUI App)
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/KeepYourSleep)

As part of a school STEM project, I developed **KeepYourSleep**, a SwiftUI app designed to help teenagers build healthier sleep habits.  
The app includes features such as:
- A reward-based shop to motivate consistent sleep routines
- Practical tips for improving sleep quality



## 3. Swift Accelerator Program
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Bryan-SAP-Apps)

I attended the **Swift Accelerator Program**, an 8-month program focused on app development using Swift and SwiftUI.  
Over the course of the program, we developed three apps, with our final app being published on the App Store.  
This experience strengthened my understanding of:
- User interface design
- App architecture
- The full development cycle

Primary school projects:
1. Robotics with mBot: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/Mbot
I learnt and had experiences on how to design, write and debug program using the Makeblock software to help mBot to complete missions and challenges. For examples, differentiate colours, perform line-following shapes such as number 8-shaped or letter T-shaped, complex movement and avoid obstacles.

2. App Development with MIT App Inventor 2: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/MITAppInventor
I learnt and had experiences building interactive mobile apps run on Android devices. I understood block-based coding and upload of application file and installation onto Android devices. During this course, I created fun and interesting apps e.g Flappy Bird, BMI Calculation and a Pitch Trainer.

3. Web Development with HTML 5, CSS 3 & Bootstrap: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/HTML
I understood the elements involved in the creations of webpages, and how to organise elements of webpages. I created my own unique portfolio webpages using Cascading Style Sheets and bootstrap, responsive and reactive Carousels and Cards as well as real-world theme e-commerce and blog post.

4. Computer Science Advanced with Python 3: https://github.com/BryanNguyenNgo/Python
I learnt programming syntax fundamentals, usage of Python libraries and packages for utility applications. I learnt object oriented, Model-View-Controller. During this course, I created automated name list for classes, a game using Pygame,
a cars website that has a login and speed calculator.

5. Web Development with Javascript
I am learning javascript programming language to create a shopping cart in the E-commerce website. Exploring different type of inputs, colours and shapes on a web page, creating interactive filtering, using jQuery and JSON.
